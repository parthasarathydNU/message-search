It is important to know what you are doing, though, so you can validate the code is correct. It has also been useful in debugging. I'm developing in Windows but deployed on a Linux server so had some quirks to figure out and the chat mode was very helpful for that (not 100% but still very good).

All this doubt and infinite possibilities of search used to put my enthusiasm down. Codeium showed me the library and practical examples: no Google! All my small software pendencies have gone!

This is a simple one, its a simple problem in CLion, in dark mode the text box in the chat feature is white, even in dark mode! This is a simple one to fix. Also this problem isn't in VS Code.\n\n2. In CLion, there are no refactor or explain options when i select a block of code, this one has been bothering me even more. Also in VS Code there are tool tips that hover over functions with the explain and refactor and generate function comment features, they are missing in CLion C++ but not in Python in CLion.\n\n3. Codeium command, a feature in VS Code (i don't know if it is in other IDEs), doesn't exist in JetBrains IDEs. I really loved this feature so i REALLY want it on CLion and other JetBrains IDEs.\n\n4. This one is another visual bug, for some reason CLion or other JetBrains IDEs let you make the chat feature smaller and smaller, until all of its elements get crushed in a small cramped window. It even lets you crush the entire thing into a single line. This one might be JetBrains's fault but please atleast try to fix it.\n\n5. This one is the biggest problem.

As someone who frequently works on JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript projects, I find this extension invaluable - it has become an indispensable part of my workflow.\n\nThe autocomplete is extremely intuitive and feels like it can read my mind at times. As soon as I start typing, Codeium pops up relevant suggestions based on the current context. Whether it's providing names for variables and functions, closing brackets and tags, or recommending entire lines of code, Codeium's suggestions are scarily accurate.\n\nBeyond autocompletion, Codeium really shines when it comes to its advanced intellisense capabilities. It provides detailed documentation on functions and methods as I type, which helps jog my memory or learn something new about a library I'm using. The extension also detects errors in my code and suggests fixes. I can't tell you how much time and headache this has saved me.\n\nInstalling and configuring Codeium is a breeze - it literally takes a few clicks. The extension has a clean, unobtrusive interface that does its job in the background without being distracting. And it's blazing fast - I don't notice any sluggishness even on large projects.\n\nIn summary, Codeium is an absolute game-changer for JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript development in VS Code. The autocompletion blows me away every time with its intelligence and accuracy. If you write code in these languages, do yourself a favor and get Codeium - it will supercharge your productivity and take your development experience to the next level. I can't recommend this extension highly enough!"

In terms of accuracy, my evaluation showed that Codeium's accuracy rate was 25.4%, while GitHub Copilot's was 56%. Additionally, I found that Codeium was slower in comparison to GitHub Copilot. It took me four times longer to complete tasks using Codeium, which I attribute to its higher latency and smaller suggestion list.\n\nCompared to GitHub Copilot, Codeium offers some advantages in terms of price and availability. It's free to use, while GitHub Copilot charges $10 per month. Additionally, Codeium is available on a wider range of platforms than GitHub Copilot. And the Codeium don't stop giving suggesting if the files contain inappropriate words like GitHub Copilot for example, I was making a tool to help suicidal people and my file had \"suicide\" word in it and because of that word I was not getting any suggestions from GitHub Copilot while Codeium worked amazingly.\n\nSo, this evaluation was done by me by manually completing the test cases. And the time taken by Codeium was 46 minutes while GitHub co-pilot took 11 minutes and 47 seconds to complete all the 163 test cases.\n\nOverall, I think that Codeium might be good for some because of its availability and the fact that it is free."
